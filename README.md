# New Missions
Not all of the Furies went to Achilles. The detatche that attacked Commander Shaw on the moon was destroyed, but the Furies held some back in reserve and shadowed their transport using a similar cloaking field to the Chinese tanks, though theirs is temporary. The transport broke off upon entering Earth's atmosphere and landed on a small island close to the south pole, coalescing drawing in furies from around the solar system.

All forces were alerted and they spared no time returning home. Now the NSDF, CCA and CRA are scrambling to set up as many defensive measures around the country as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, the **American Black Dogs**, **Russian Crimson Bears** and **Chinese Green Dragons** are sent to the island where they will coordinate as a joint task force to destroy the remaining Furies, but they've enhanced themselves in dangerous ways. 

Humanity's fate hangs in the balance. Are you prepared for the hardest fight yet, Colonel Hullerd?

## Upgrade System
A brand new feature exclusive to Total Command+, this system is designed to reward commanders who take certain risks. This system allows commanders to augment themselves, their forces, their weapons, and even unlock some useful calldowns.

### Ancient Scrap
The prime materials needed in order to apply upgrades, these can be earned by completing missions successfully (1 per each mission, but some successful mission endings add extra). The vast majority of Ancient Scrap can be earned via **bonus objectives** that will challenge commanders to complete them in certain ways or within time restrictions. These are optional and do not affect the campaign in any way.

However, Scrap is only added to your arsenal upon mission success. Any scrap earned during that specific mission instance will be lost otherwise, but any earned from previous attempts is permanently kept. 
Scrap can only be earned once, but the bonus goals can be repeated as many times as desired and will instead reward powerups, instant scrap deposits or other things to ease the rest of the mission.
