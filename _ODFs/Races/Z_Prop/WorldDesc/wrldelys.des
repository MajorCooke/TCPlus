Orbiting a dwarf star at an unknown location, possibly within the Milkyway galaxy or another, this planet is presumed to have once been Earth-like on its surface. It was once populated by Cthonians, as evidenced by the remains of at least one large city. At present the atmosphere is barely breathable and unable to support complex lifeforms. Its surface is dotted with bio-metal pools, and holds potential for archeological research.
